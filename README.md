📺 Netflix Data Analysis with Python
This data analysis project explores a dataset of Netflix shows and movies to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to content production, release timelines, and distribution.

Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, this project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer key questions about Netflix's content library.

Clean and preprocess Netflix dataset.

Understand the distribution of TV shows vs movies.

Identify top countries contributing to Netflix content.

Analyze release trends over the years.

Explore ratings, durations, and genre diversity.

Visualize key findings using interactive and static plots.
